    <div class="content-area" id="expandableContent1">
      <p>Chemical systems in isolation will approach thermodynamic equilibrium, a unique steady state with no net flows of matter or energy. In biology, thermodynamic equilibrium is synonymous with death and systems must avoid it by continuously spending energy; staying out of equilibrium is a principle of life. At the molecular scale, one way energy is spent is to ensure that one molecule reacts specifically with its correct partner.  Such accurate discrimination is essential for processes such as translation, where the correct tRNA must be selected to ensure the fidelity of the resulting protein.</p>
      <p>One fundamental question is why large multicomponent protein complexes often form around the specific interaction of two molecules.  One proposal from equilibrium considerations is that each complex forms a sort of molecular memory state and that by tuning the interactions between subunits, memories can be recalled from smaller seed complexes.  Some recent work I have done with Gaurav Venkataraman proposed a complementary perspective from a non-equilibrium point of view. We discovered that complex formation may serve as an out-of-equilibrium discrimination mechanism where the spending of free energy is used to increase the specificity of the interaction using either binding energy differences, i.e., Hopfield's kinetic proofreading, or activation energy differences. We found that one or the other of these mechanisms is favoured depending on whether complex formation occurs in a processive or distributive manner.</p>
      <p>We quantified this with what we call orthogonality and show how this quantity can be used to predict when complexes are likely to achieve accuracy by processive assembly versus distributive assembly. We also showed how changing the propensity of a single reaction, such as phosphorylating a component, can shift the assembly between these two regimes.  Our results predict that distributive complex formation should be more dissipative, rely on decreased kinetic barriers, and involve molecules with many heterogeneous multivalent interactions.  These properties are interestingly often associated with phase-separated granules, and I would like to investigate the potential for these to serve as computational centres in the cell.</p>

      <div class="content-area" id="expandableContent2">
      <p>Complex structure is often composed from a limited set of relatively simple building blocks; such as novels from letters or proteins from amino acids.  In musical composition, e.g., sounds and silences combine to form longer time scale structures; motifs form passages which in turn form movements.  The challenge we address is how to identify collective variables which distinguish structures across such disparate time scales. We introduce a principled framework for learning effective descriptions directly from observations. Just as a musical piece transitions from one movement to the next, the collective dynamics we infer consists of transitions between macroscopic states, like jumps between meta-stable states in an effective potential landscape.</p>
      <p>The statistics of these transitions are captured compactly by transfer operators. These operators play a central role, guiding the construction of maximally-predictive short-time states from incomplete measurements and identifying collective modes via eigenvalue decomposition.  We demonstrate our analysis in both stochastic and deterministic systems, and with an application to the movement dynamics of an entire organism, unravelling new insight in long time scale behavioral states directly from measurements of posture dynamics.</p>
      <p>We can, in principle, also make connections to both longer or shorter timescales. Microscopically, postural dynamics result from the fine scale interactions of actin and myosin in the muscles, and from electrical impulses in the brain and nervous system. Macroscopically, behavioral dynamics may be extended to longer time scales, to moods or dispositions, including changes during aging, or over generations due to ecological or evolutionary adaptation. The generality of our approach provides opportunity for insights on long term dynamics within a wide variety of complex systems.</p>

      <div class="content-area" id="expandableContent3">
      <p>Theoretical physics allows for prediction of natural phenomena with incredible accuracy. However, for biological systems, few general theoretical frameworks can make predictions with similar accuracy and scope. Theory in biology seeks to explain how biological systems evolve, maintain, and diversify. One of the most important theories is that of evolution by natural selection, and despite its central importance, it often fails to make quantitative predictions for evolutionary processes. Our work aims to develop foundational quantitative theories for biological systems. </p>
      <p>Phenotypes, i.e., the forms and functions, of living systems, are of central importance to our approach. Phenotypic variation is the raw material of both adaptation and diversification as well as the ultimate target of natural selection. A phenotypic space is a geometric description which captures quantitatively the diversity and correlation structure between different phenotypes. Our work explores the structure of the phenotypic space of the roundworm C. elegans from experiments using custom-made parallel automated imaging machines to measure development, growth, and reproduction simultaneously in many hundreds of individuals across different environments. </p>
      <p>Our results  indicate that the phenotypic variation among isogenic individuals may mirror the variation that emerges via ecological or genetic change, providing a possible way to predict favorable directions for adaptation and evolution. By performing dimensionality reduction on developmental traits, we find new effective traits which can be described on a relatively low dimensional manifold. We find that this dimensionality reduction can transform a representation of quantitative traits which show significant gene cross environment interactions into one in which the effects of genetic background and environment can be deconvolved independently from one another. This may allow for more parsimonious genotype to phenotype maps and has implications for quantitative trait analyses.</p>
      <p>We propose that this phenomenon of concentration of dimension may not be unique to nematode growth, but rather a feature of biological systems in general, providing a mechanism for both robustness and flexibility.  We are currently working to develop a  framework based on projection operator theory from statistical mechanics to describe how this phenomenon may arise.</p>

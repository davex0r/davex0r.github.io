As a concrete example, let us imagine there is an organism which takes a triangular shape as its sole phenotype and we would like to quantify the phenotypic diversity.  A triangle is the simplest geometric shape, counter-intuitively however, there are an infinite number of different triangles.  A rigorous definition of diversity must be able to answer questions such as, "of the possible triangular shapes, what fraction is represented in our sample?". This analogy highlights some of the difficulties in defining phenotypic diversity.  We could count the number of different triangles that are grossly different (different "species" of triangle), but this definition relies on a subjective notion of gross difference.  Furthermore, it is impossible to define whether any given number of "species" is large or small in relation to what is possible.

To provide a way forward, we now introduce the idea of a parameter space, which is one way to formulate rigorously a definition of the diversity of triangular shapes.  Instead of asking "how many different triangles are there", instead consider how many parameters are required to generate all triangular shapes.  Recall that one simple parameterization of triangular shapes is to specify the length of two sides and the angle between them.  Box 1 allows you to change the length of the l1 and l2 as well as theta, and shows the resulting triangular shape.  Now the entirety of triangular shape space can be described with three parameters, or knobs, that can tuned to give any shape.  This three-parameter space is more consistent with our notion that triangular shapes are geometrically simple.


The parameterization we choose determines locality on the manifold, and trajectories through different parameter spaces give different sequences through shape space

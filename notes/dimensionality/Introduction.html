When one looks at the natural world, the diversity of biological form and function is often striking.  We suspect, and evidence supports \cite{Theobald:2010aa}, that existing biological forms (fish, trees, birds, ants, and humans e.g.) have arisen from a common ancestor.  Evolutionary theory, laid out in Charles Darwin's 1859 "On the Origin of Species", describes a procedure whereby populations adapt to changing environments by introducing modifications into the forms or functions of their offspring. If these modifications provide advantages, those individuals carrying them will be more likely to survive and reproduce.  This routine, descent with modification followed by natural selection, repeated faithfully since life first arose on earth, is thought to have produced all of the diversity of biological forms and functions, so-called phenotypic diversity, that we today observe.

While this procedure provides a powerful algorithmic description of the process of evolution, it does not easily provide quantitative predictions.  For example, geological estimates put the age of the earth at 4.54 billion years old, if, however, this was proved to be wrong by three orders of magnitude, no current evolutionary theory makes predictions about whether the current amount of phenotypic diversity we observe is possible or not.  In fact, it is unclear even how one might define an "amount of phenotypic diversity".  Such a definition requires a rigorous and quantitative a measure of phenotypic diversity.  Discrete phenotypes can be counted, but continuous phenotypes are in theory infinite.

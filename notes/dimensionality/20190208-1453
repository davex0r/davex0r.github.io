Dimensionality Review

Dimensionality Reduction
  Introduction to Dimensionality Reduction
    Triangle space
      Proportion of acute triangles
      Expectation, models of randomness, and uniform distributions
      Learning a space from data
        Procrustes Transformation
        Similar Triangles (Shape Space vs. Size)
      Locality
      Trajectories
  Phenotypic Spaces (Morphospaces (Seashells, Antigen Shape Space))
    Morphospaces - D'arcy Thmopson (Growth and Form)
    Seashells - Raup
    Influenza shape space
  Behavioral Spaces (Eigenworms, Posture Space)
    Original Eigenworms paper (greg)
    Hierachrcal compression paper (andre) (ethology as physical science)
    My Paper (Tetrahymena)
  Dimensionality Reduction Techniques
    Back to triangle space (PCA, surface of sphere)
    Distance Metrics
    Embedding (PCA, MDS, non-linear methods (LLE, isomap, t-SNE, diffusion maps))
  Pareto Optimality and Pareto Fronts
    Pareto optimality, generalist, specialist, pareto front
Dimensionality Expansion
  Classification and Learning - Kernel SVM
  Computation (Function Generation, BingKan Paper)
  Prediction and Control (Koopman Operator)

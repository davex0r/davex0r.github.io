  abstract = "A general relationship between fluctuation and response in a
              biological system is presented. The fluctuation is given by the
              variance of some quantity, whereas the response is given as the
              average change of that quantity for a given parameter change. We
              propose a relationship where the two are proportional, in a
              similar way to the fluctuation-dissipation theorem in physics. By
              studying an evolution experiment where fluorescence of protein in
              bacteria increases, we confirm our relation by observing a
              positive correlation between the speed of fluorescence evolution
              and the phenotypic fluctuation of the fluorescence over clone
              bacteria. The generality of the relationship as well as its
              relevance to evolution is discussed.",

               discriminate in alternate limits",

  abstract  = "We study biochemical reaction networks capable of product
               discrimination inspired by biological proofreading mechanisms.
               At equilibrium, product discrimination, the selective formation
               of a `correct' product with respect to an `incorrect product',
               is fundamentally limited by the free energy difference between
               the two products. However, biological systems often far exceed
               this limit, by using discriminatory networks that expend free
               energy to maintain non-equilibrium steady states.
               Non-equilibrium systems are notoriously difficult to analyze and
               no systematic methods exist for determining parameter regimes
               which maximize discrimination. Here we introduce a measure that
               can be computed directly from the biochemical rate constants
               which provides a condition for proofreading in a broad class of
               models, making it a useful objective function for optimizing
               discrimination schemes. Our results suggest that this measure is
               related to whether a network is processive or distributive.
               Processive networks are those that have a single dominant
               pathway for reaction progression, such as a protein complex that
               must be assembled sequentially. While distributive networks are
               those that have many effective pathways from the reactant to the
               product state; e.g. a protein complex in which the subunits can
               associate in any order. Non-equilibrium systems can discriminate
               using either binding energy (energetic) differences or
               activation energy (kinetic) differences. In both cases,
               proofreading is optimal when dissipation is maximized. In this
               work, we show that for a general class of proofreading networks,
               energetic discrimination requires processivity and kinetic
               discrimination requiring distributivity. Optimal discrimination
               thus requires both maximizing dissipation and being in the
               correct processive/distributive limit. Sometimes, adjusting a
               single rate may put these requirements in opposition and in
               these cases, the error may be a non-monotonic function of that
               rate. This provides an explanation for the observation that the
               error is a non-monotonic function of the irreversible drive in
               the original proofreading scheme of Hopfield and Ninio. Finally,
               we introduce mixed networks, in which one product is favored
               energetically and the other kinetically. In such networks,
               sensitive product switching can be achieved simply by spending
               free energy to drive the network toward either the processive
               limit or the distributive limit. Biologically, this corresponds
               to the ability to select between products by driving a single
               reaction without network fine tuning. This may be used to
               explore alternate product spaces in challenging environments.",

              process in biology, but how is energy apportioned between the
              conflicting demands of accuracy ($\mu$), speed ($\sigma$), and
              total entropy production rate (P)? Previous studies have focused
              on biochemical networks with simple structure or relied on
              simplifying kinetic assumptions. Here, we use the linear
              framework for timescale separation to analytically examine
              steady-state probabilities away from thermodynamic equilibrium
              for networks of arbitrary complexity. We also introduce a method
              of scaling parameters that is inspired by Hopfield's treatment of
              kinetic proofreading. Scaling allows asymptotic exploration of
              high-dimensional parameter spaces. We identify in this way a
              broad class of complex networks and scalings for which the
              quantity $\sigma$ln($\mu$)/P remains asymptotically finite
              whenever accuracy improves from equilibrium, so that
              $\mu$\_\{eq\}/$\mu$$\rightarrow$0. Scalings exist, however, even
              for Hopfield's original network, for which $\sigma$ln($\mu$)/P is
              asymptotically infinite, illustrating the parametric complexity.
              Outside the asymptotic regime, numerical calculations suggest
              that, under more restrictive parametric assumptions, networks
              satisfy the bound, $\sigma$ln($\mu$/$\mu$\_\{eq\})/P<1, and we
              discuss the biological implications for discrimination by
              ribosomes and DNA polymerase. The methods introduced here may be

              other forms of cellular information processing.",

              phenotype changes first via adaptation in response to
              environmental changes, and then through mutational changes in the
              genomic sequence, followed by selection in evolution. Here, we
              analysed simulated adaptive evolution using a simple cell model
              consisting of thousands of intracellular components, and found
              that the changes in their concentrations by adaptation are
              proportional to those by evolution across all the components,
              where the proportion coefficient between the two agreed well with
              the change in the growth rate of a cell. Furthermore, we
              demonstrate that the phenotypic variance in concentrations of
              cellular components due to (non-genetic) noise and to genomic
              alternations is proportional across all components. This implies
              that the specific phenotypes that are highly evolvable were

               expressed in terms of fluctuation properties of the system in

                   that synapses are the storage sites of memory, and that
                   memories are formed through associative modification of
                   synapses. This view has been challenged on conceptual and
                   empirical grounds. As an alternative, it has been proposed

              assembles these activities into organized behaviors like action
              sequences. Using brain-wide calcium imaging in Caenorhabditis
              elegans, we show that a large proportion of neurons across the
              brain share information by engaging in coordinated, dynamical
              network activity. This brain state evolves on a cycle, each
              segment of which recruits the activities of different neuronal
              sub-populations and can be explicitly mapped, on a single trial
              basis, to the animals' major motor commands. This organization
              defines the assembly of motor commands into a string of
              run-and-turn action sequence cycles, including decisions between
              alternative behaviors. These dynamics serve as a robust scaffold
              for action selection in response to sensory input. This study
              shows that the coordination of neuronal activity patterns into
              global brain dynamics underlies the high-level organization of
              behavior.",

                   behavioral states. We take short posture sequences as an
                   instantaneous behavioral measure, fixing the sequence length
                   for maximal prediction. Within the space of posture
                   sequences we construct a fine-scale, maximum entropy
                   partition so that transitions among microstates define a
                   high-fidelity Markov model, which we also use as a means of
                   principled coarse-graining. We translate these dynamics into
                   movement using resistive force theory, capturing the
                   statistical properties of foraging trajectories. Predictive
                   across scales, we leverage the longest-lived eigenvectors of
                   the inferred Markov chain to perform a top-down subdivision
                   of the worm's foraging behavior, revealing both
                   ``runs-and-pirouettes'' as well as previously

                   investigate the relevance of these fine-scale behaviors for
                   foraging success, recovering a trade-off between local and
                   global search strategies.",

  abstract = "In previous work, we have introduced a ``linear framework'' for
              time-scale separation in biochemical systems, which is based on a
              labelled, directed graph, G, and an associated linear
              differential equation, dx/dt = L(G) ∙ x, where L(G) is the
              Laplacian matrix of G. Biochemical nonlinearity is encoded in the
              graph labels. Many central results in molecular biology can be
              systematically derived within this framework, including those for
              enzyme kinetics, allosteric proteins, G-protein coupled
              receptors, ion channels, gene regulation at thermodynamic
              equilibrium, and protein post-translational modification. In the
              present paper, in response to new applications, which accommodate
              nonequilibrium mechanisms in eukaryotic gene regulation, we lay
              out the mathematical foundations of the framework. We show that,
              for any graph and any initial condition, the dynamics always
              reaches a steady state, which can be algorithmically calculated.
              If the graph is not strongly connected, which may occur in gene
              regulation, we show that the dynamics can exhibit flexible
              behavior that resembles multistability. We further reveal an
              unexpected equivalence between deterministic Laplacian dynamics
              and the master equations of continuous-time Markov processes,
              which allows rigorous treatment within the framework of

  abstract = "The mitochondrion is often referred as the cellular powerhouse
              because the organelle oxidizes organic acids and NADH derived
              from nutriments, converting around 40\% of the Gibbs free energy
              change of these reactions into ATP, the major energy currency of
              cell metabolism. Mitochondria are thus microscopic furnaces that
              inevitably release heat as a by-product of these reactions, and
              this contributes to body warming, especially in endotherms like
              birds and mammals. Over the last decade, the idea has emerged
              that mitochondria could be warmer than the cytosol, because of
              their intense energy metabolism. It has even been suggested that
              our own mitochondria could operate under normal conditions at a
              temperature close to 50 °C, something difficult to reconcile with
              the laws of thermal physics. Here, using our combined expertise
              in biology and physics, we exhaustively review the reports that
              led to the concept of a hot mitochondrion, which is essentially
              based on the development and use of a variety of molecular
              thermosensors whose intrinsic fluorescence is modified by
              temperature. Then, we discuss the physical concepts of heat
              diffusion, including mechanisms like phonons scattering, which
              occur in the nanoscale range. Although most of approaches with
              thermosensors studies present relatively sparse data and lack
              absolute temperature calibration, overall, they do support the
              hypothesis of hot mitochondria. However, there is no convincing

              higher temperature than its surroundings. We nevertheless

               accessible or measurable in real-world systems. As a
               consequence, the proper setting for empirical modeling is that
               of partially-observed systems. Notably, data-driven models
               consistently outperform physics-based models for systems with
               few observable degrees of freedom; e.g. hydrological systems.
               Here, we provide an operator-theoretic explanation for this
               empirical success. To predict a partially-observed system's
               future behavior with physics-based models, the missing degrees
               of freedom must be explicitly accounted for using data
               assimilation and model parametrization. Data-driven models, in
               contrast, employ delay-coordinate embeddings and their evolution
               under the Koopman operator to implicitly model the effects of
               the missing degrees of freedom. We describe in detail the
               statistical physics of partial observations underlying
               data-driven models using novel maximum entropy and maximum
               caliber measures. The resulting nonequilibrium Wiener

               data-driven models may converge to the true dynamics of the
               observable degrees of freedom. Additionally, this framework
               shows how data-driven models infer the effects of unobserved
               degrees of freedom implicitly, in much the same way that physics
               models infer the effects explicitly. This provides a unified
               implicit-explicit modeling framework for predicting

              determining ecosystem structure at all scales, from microbial
              communities to the entire biosphere. Stable cycles are essential
              for ecosystem persistence because they allow resources and
              nutrients to be regenerated. Therefore, a central problem in
              ecology is understanding how ecosystems are organized to sustain
              robust cycles. Addressing this problem quantitatively has proved
              challenging because of the difficulties associated with
              manipulating ecosystem structure while measuring cycling. We
              address this problem using closed microbial ecosystems (CES),

              from the sun. However, to harness this energy, organisms must
              transform matter from one chemical (`redox') state to another.
              For example, photosynthetic organisms can capture light energy by
              carrying out a pair of electron donor and acceptor
              transformations (e.g., water to oxygen, CO2 to organic carbon).
              Closure of ecosystems to matter requires that all such
              transformations are ultimately balanced, i.e., other organisms
              must carry out corresponding reverse transformations, resulting
              in cycles that are coupled to each other. A sustainable closed
              ecosystem thus requires self-organized cycles of matter, in which
              every transformation has sufficient thermodynamic favorability to
              maintain an adequate number of organisms carrying out that
              process. Here, we propose a new conceptual model that explains
              the self-organization and emergent features of closed ecosystems.
              We study this model with varying levels of metabolic diversity
              and energy input, finding that several thermodynamic features
              converge across ecosystems. Specifically, irrespective of their
              species composition, large and metabolically diverse communities
              self-organize to extract $\approx$ 10\% of the maximum
              extractable energy, or $\approx$ 100 fold more than randomized
              communities. Moreover, distinct communities implement energy
              extraction in convergent ways, as indicated by strongly
              correlated fluxes through nutrient cycles. As the driving force
              from light increases, however, these features -- fluxes and total
              energy extraction -- become more variable across communities,
              indicating that energy limitation imposes tight thermodynamic

              such sequence. SQRMs have a 5' fluorophore, a quenching moiety on

              5-basepaired stem, and a loop sequence of approximately 20-30

  abstract = "The genotype-phenotype mapping of proteins is a fundamental
              question in structural biology. In this Letter, with the analysis
              of a large dataset of proteins from hundreds of protein families,
              we quantitatively demonstrate the correlations between the
              noise-induced protein dynamics and mutation-induced variations of
              native structures, indicating the dynamics-evolution
              correspondence of proteins. Based on the investigations of the
              linear responses of native proteins, the origin of such a
              correspondence is elucidated. It is essential that the noise- and
              mutation-induced deformations of the proteins are restricted on a
              common low-dimensional subspace, as confirmed from the data.
              These results suggest an evolutionary mechanism of the proteins
              gaining both dynamical flexibility and evolutionary structural
              variability.",

  abstract = "According to recent experimental evidence, promoter architecture,
              defined by the number, strength and regulatory role of the
              operators that control transcription, plays a major role in
              determining the level of cell-to-cell variability in gene
              expression. These quantitative experiments call for a
              corresponding modeling effort that addresses the question of how
              changes in promoter architecture affect variability in gene
              expression in a systematic rather than case-by-case fashion. In
              this article we make such a systematic investigation, based on a
              microscopic model of gene regulation that incorporates stochastic
              effects. In particular, we show how operator strength and
              operator multiplicity affect this variability. We examine
              different modes of transcription factor binding to complex
              promoters (cooperative, independent, simultaneous) and how each
              of these affects the level of variability in transcriptional
              output from cell-to-cell. We propose that direct comparison
              between in vivo single-cell experiments and theoretical
              predictions for the moments of the probability distribution of
              mRNA number per cell can be used to test kinetic models of gene
              regulation. The emphasis of the discussion is on prokaryotic gene
              regulation, but our analysis can be extended to eukaryotic cells
              as well.",

              understanding evolution--lag behind investigations of genetic
              diversity. Here we develop a quantitative approach to studying
              behavioral diversity, which we apply to swimming of the ciliate
              Tetrahymena. We measure the full-lifetime behavior of hundreds of
              individual organisms at high temporal resolution, over several
              generations and in diverse nutrient conditions. To characterize
              population diversity and temporal variability we introduce a
              unique statistical framework grounded in the notion of a
              phenotypic space of behaviors. We show that this space is
              effectively low dimensional with dimensions that correlate with a
              two-state ``roaming and dwelling'' model of swimming behavior.
              Temporal variability over the lifetime of an individual is
              correlated with the fraction of time spent roaming whereas
              diversity between individuals is correlated with the speed of
              roaming. Quantifying the dynamics of behavioral variation shows
              that behavior over the lifetime of an individual is strongly
              nonstationary. Analysis of behavioral dynamics between
              generations reveals complex patterns of behavioral heritability
              that point to the importance of considering correlations beyond
              mothers and daughters. Our description of a low-dimensional
              behavioral space should enable the systematic study of the
              evolutionary and ecological bases of phenotypic constraints.
              Future experimental and theoretical studies of behavioral
              diversity will have to account for the possibility of
              nonstationary and environmentally dependent behavioral dynamics
              that we observe.",
